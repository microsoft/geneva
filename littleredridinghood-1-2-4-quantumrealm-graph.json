grandmother.\nBeat 15: Red, using quantum algorithms, distinguishes the real grandmother from the decoy.\nBeat 16: Red rescues her grandmother and they teleport back to the lab, leaving the Quantum Wolf behind.\nBeat 17: Red's grandmother sends her quantum coordinates to a Quantum Rose, a rare entity that can stabilize quantum fluctuations.\nBeat 18: The Quantum Wolf tries to devour the Quantum Rose, causing quantum chaos.\nBeat 19: Red uses her quantum device to restore order and retrieve the Quantum Rose.\nBeat 20: Red and her grandmother return to the lab, using the Quantum Rose to stabilize the teleportation process.\n\nCommon intermediate Beats: Beat 3, Beat 4\n\nStorylines (4)\nStoryline 1: START_1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, END_1\nStoryline 2: START_1, 1, 8, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11,
